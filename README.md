# Star Wars Films

### About Star Wars Films

A star wars film search web application idea built in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) based on [Swapi API](https://swapi.dev/) and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Design

The designs the project is based on can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/MDZZeWq0PKPNtZVjTdMpV3/Films). The Figma design file has both mobile and desktop layout ideas of how the application should look like in the Design page. (Only the desktop layout has a prototype showing how a simple search can be performed)

### Figma design file pages are as follows:

-**Design** - Contains Desktop and mobile layout -**Logo** - Project logo -**Icons** - Costume designed assets

### Other design resources

The colors in the design are mostly sourced from my [Colors's](https://ick-seshoka.github.io/colors/#/) color pallet
